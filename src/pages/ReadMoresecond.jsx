          </h5>
          <p className="softwork-para1">
            ● The process begins with the installation of multiple cameras
            strategically positioned throughout the warehouse.
            <br />
            ● These cameras continuously capture the movements of incoming items
            and objects, generating a continuous stream of video data.
